	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>My name is Nuel Deli. I'm a self-taught programmer and full-stack developer.</p>

	<p>As someone that came from Social Science background, I started my programming journey in late 2018. At first, it was as a hobby. Now, it's for commercial. Python is my preffered programming language.</p>

	<p>For my previous work, I was a graphic designer (having experience in freelance and working under companies).</p>

	<p>2020 was the year of my first programming job. My assignments were to design and write code for a web-based system for the state's government.</p>
